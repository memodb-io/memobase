title: What is Memobase?
---

Struggling with short-term memory in your AI applications? Memobase is the solution.

It's a fast, scalable, long-term **user memory backend** for your AI, helping you build applications that remember and understand their users.

## Multi-Lingual Support

To optimize performance across different languages, Memobase comes with **built-in multi-lingual prompts**. Currently supported languages include:
- **English (en)** - Default language
- **Chinese (zh)** - Optimized for Chinese-speaking users
- **Japanese (ja)** - Optimized for Japanese-speaking users

This means you can configure Memobase to use native language prompts for better accuracy and performance when working with non-English content. Learn more in the [configuration reference](/references/local_config).

Memobase is under active development, and we are looking for early adopters to become our design partners.
