</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### User Data Management
Once you created a user, you can start to manage user data.
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Insert Data">
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from memobase import ChatBlob
b = ChatBlob(messages=[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hi, I'm here again"
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Hi, Gus! How can I help you?"
    }
])
u = client.get_user(uid)
bid = u.insert(b)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "$PROJECT_URL/api/v1/blobs/insert/{uid}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "blob_type": "chat", "blob_data": { "messages": [ {"role": "user","content": "Hi, Im here again"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, Gus! How can I help you?"}] }}'
```

```json Output
{"data":{"id":"60377b0b-bf46-BLOB-UUID-2fbc6a38a884"},"errno":0,"errmsg":""}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get">
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
b = u.get(bid)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "$PROJECT_URL/api/v1/blobs/{uid}/{bid}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_TOKEN"
```

```json Output
{
    "data":{
        "blob_type":"chat",
        "blob_data":{
            "messages":[
                {"role":"user","alias":null,"content":"Hi, Im here again"},
                {"role":"assistant","alias":null,"content":"Hi, Gus! How can I help you?"}
                ]
            },
        "fields":null,
        "created_at":"2024-11-23T08:38:22.067493",
        "updated_at":"2024-11-23T08:38:22.067493"
    },
    "errno":0,

```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete">
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
u.delete(bid)

```
```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "$PROJECT_URL/api/v1/blobs/{uid}/{bid}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_TOKEN"
```

```json Output
{"data":null,"errno":0,"errmsg":""}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Memory Operations
MemoBase provides memory extraction and storage for each user：
1. `flush`: User Data will stay in buffer until the buffer is too big or IDLE for too long. You can flush the buffer to trigger the memory extraction manually

<Accordion title="Flush" description="e.g. After a chat session is closed">
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
u.flush()
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "$PROJECT_URL/api/v1/users/buffer/{uid}/chat" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_TOKEN"
```

```json Output
{"data":null,"errno":0,"errmsg":""}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

2. `profile`: Get the memory profiles of a user.

<Accordion title="User Profile">
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
u.profile()
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "$PROJECT_URL/api/v1/users/profile/{uid}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_TOKEN"
```

```json Output
{
    "data":{
        "profiles":[
            {
                "content":"Gus",
                "attributes":{"topic":"basic_info","sub_topic":"name"},

                "id":"186bdbf0-ce35-4608-9404-47af27000f7f",
                "related_blobs":["9af94328-526e-486e-a411-efffdd8fc37e"],
                "created_at":"2024-11-23T08:53:14.227481",
                "updated_at":"2024-11-23T08:53:14.227481",
            }
        ]
    },
    "errno":0,
    "errmsg":""}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

3. Pack the profiles into your system prompt:


<Accordion title="Prompt Example" description="Example Profile from ShareGPT">
<CodeGroup>

```txt Prompt
Below are the user profile:
* basic_info: name - 오*영
* basic_info: language_spoken - User uses both English and Korean.
* contact_info: email - s****2@ca**rp.com
* education:  - User had an English teacher who emphasized capitalization rules during school days.
* education: major - 국어국문학과 (Korean Language and Literature)
* demographics: marital_status - user is married
...
You should be aware of these information when you talk to the user.
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
